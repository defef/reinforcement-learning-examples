# reinforcement-learning-samples
These are example Keras implementations of deep reinforcement learning algorithms applied to openai.com environments.

The algorithms include:
1. Policy gradient with both action and value functions implemented as neural nets applied to the Cart-Pole environment.
2. Basic DQN algorithm applied to the Cart-Pole environment.
3. DQN with experience replay applied to the Cart-Pole environment.
